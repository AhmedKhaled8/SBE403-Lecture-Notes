# SBE403-Lecture-Notes

This repository contains markdown files of the lectures including examples explained in the lectures and explaination to some of the content discussed in the lectures.

It's encouraged to read the files on github instead of downloading the files as these files will be updated in case if there are mistakes, I will update the files ASAP.

If you find any mistake(coding or spelling) and if you find it'd be better to add some examples, explaination, etc., please let me know and I wil update the files.

Missing lectures will be added later no worries.
